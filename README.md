# UBHacking2021

## Noah Wichlacz, The Event

This hack was originally designed and tested in RemixIDE, an Ethereum Blockchain IDE for solidity.
I then pushed it onto a local blockchain that I ran through Ganache, in the Truffle Suite.
I am able to fully interact with the backend code, yet I am still unsure on the front end and how to build that.
